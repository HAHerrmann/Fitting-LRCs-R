Fitting Light Response Curves (LRCs) to Photosynthetis Data in R 

LRCs of photosynthetis are often described using the following equation:

Here you can find example R scripts and example data for fitting the above equation to photosynthesis LRC data in R.

This will allow you to estimate each of the parameters in the above equation given your data. 

For a more detailed description on the fitting proceedure and what the different parameters mean, please see my [blog](insert link).
